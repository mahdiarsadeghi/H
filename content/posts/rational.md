## First words

This is my first official hallucination. I am thrilled to deliver what has been on my mind for so long. A fetus grown in my brain is now qualified to leave its shell. Wilderness exposure is not going to take it easy on him. I am determined to take a good care of this newborn until it stands on its own feet. Cannot wait to see that moment, which might just be the start trouble, like most toddlers who get to know their boundaries as they get more power during growth. 

## Definitions
In the near future, I will try to be concerned of delicate matters of early days. Because, I know my brain is usually tuned on over-concerned mode where problems of the future become its day to day challenge. This realization started with a few sparse observations, where the apparent concern of my brain was the *future* instead being in the *moment*. Hallucination emphasis is the moment, when reality is too predictable, or boring! In a sense of healthy exercise. Imagine having a great super power where you might not have to use it frequently, then there should be a need to practice the super power. A rational exercise leads to enlightenment in the moment. Careful decluttering is necessary when an outcome evolves to a conclusion. Any hallucination story includes a non-tangible material by definition, therefore applicability of a hallucination is limited to the definition, and any exaggeration undermines sanity of a hallucinator who over-enjoys the exercise.

## Footnote
I am having too much fun generating cartoons with DALL-E, isn’t it a great technology? It could be better, but for what its worth it’s an unparalleled tool compared to a decades ago where authors worked with papers.
